### Explanation of the Runtime and Memory requirements for Solution 3
> Using the Big O Notation

The worst case time complexity or **Runtime** is **O(n)** where n is the number of times the algorithm traverses for opposite leaf nodes to the root node.

The worst case space complexity or **Memory Footprint** is **O(n)** as well, where n is the number of times the algorithm traverses for opposite leaf nodes to the root node.
